# fncoach_prototype
## A smart note-taking app for Fortnite players looking to improve.

## What is it?
In its current state, fncoach doesn't do much. Here's what it currently does:
* Updates library of weapons/locations & populates GUI with this information.
* Takes user input.
* Sends user input to a local SQLite3 database.

Here's what I want it to do:
* Analyze the user's inputted data.
* Use predeictive modeling to determine players' playstyle.
* Suggest improvements/what to practice based on this information.
* Display useful statistics (ie. what weapon you die to the most).

## Who is it for?
The application is for anyone looking to improve at the game, but needs a headstart in developing an active analytical playstyle. 
* Beginners can use it to determine their initial playstyle and make adjustments accordingly.
* Intermediate players can use it to take their gameplay to the next level.
* Pro players can use it as a valuable reflection tool to discover areas of weakness.

## When can you try it?
I'll be updating this readme every 2 weeks, and keeping track of the development process in a devlog. As soon as it's in a functional state, I'll be looking for user feedback.
